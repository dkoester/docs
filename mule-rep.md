## Mule Rep Questions

##### 2/20/2020
1. CPU usage policy - > 4 licensed cores on 16 core box.
   - box usage already high, will increased cores impact how mule/licensing runs
2. Support Process -> Difficult
  - full 1 day turnaround, 2 days typically
3. Logging/Monitoring/Alerting/ Other features we aren't using yet
  - want to use ELK to centralized logs, what does this look like
  - want to set up monitoring/alerts, what have other customers done. I saw you utilize influx
4. Mule 3 ->  Mule 4 Conversion
  - is this a feature full upgrade, i.e. is 3 entirely compatible with 4
  - how often are other customers realistically upgrading things like mule agent/ etc
5. Cloudhub Conversion
  - what does a POC look like
  - how much time does this typically take per app
